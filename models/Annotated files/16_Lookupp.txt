16.14.  Operation 16: LOOKUPP - Look Up Parent Directory

16.14.1.  SYNOPSIS

     (cfh) -> (cfh)

16.14.2.  ARGUMENT

     /* CURRENT_FH: object */
     void;

16.14.3.  RESULT

   struct LOOKUPP4res {
           /* CURRENT_FH: directory */
           nfsstat4        status;
   };

16.14.4.  DESCRIPTION

The current filehandle is assumed to refer to a regular directory or a named attribute directory <NULL>.  LOOKUPP assigns the filehandle for its parent directory to be the current filehandle <NULL>.  If there is no parent directory, an NFS4ERR_NOENT error must be returned <NULL>.  Therefore, NFS4ERR_NOENT will be returned by the server when the current filehandle is at the root or top of the server's file tree <NULL>.

16.14.5.  IMPLEMENTATION

As for LOOKUP, LOOKUPP will also cross mount points <NULL>.

If the current filehandle is not a directory or named attribute directory, the error NFS4ERR_NOTDIR is returned <NULL>.

If the current filehandle is a named attribute directory that is associated with a file system object via OPENATTR (i.e., not a subdirectory of a named attribute directory), LOOKUPP SHOULD return the filehandle of the associated file system object <NULL>.
