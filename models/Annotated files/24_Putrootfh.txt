16.22.4.  DESCRIPTION

PUTROOTFH replaces the current filehandle with the filehandle that represents the root of the server's namespace <NULL>.  From this filehandle, a LOOKUP operation can locate any other filehandle on the server <NULL>. This filehandle may be different from the public filehandle, which may be associated with some other directory on the server <NULL>.  See Section 15.2.4.1 for more details on the current filehandle <NULL>.

16.22.5.  IMPLEMENTATION

PUTROOTFH is commonly used as the first operator in an NFS request to set the context for operations that follow it <NULL>.
