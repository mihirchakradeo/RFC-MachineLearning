16.29.  Operation 31: RESTOREFH - Restore Saved Filehandle

16.29.1.  SYNOPSIS

     (sfh) -> (cfh)

16.29.2.  ARGUMENT

     /* SAVED_FH: */
     void;

16.29.3.  RESULT

   struct RESTOREFH4res {
           /* CURRENT_FH: value of saved fh */
           nfsstat4        status;
   };

16.29.4.  DESCRIPTION

Set the current filehandle to the value in the saved filehandle <NULL>.  If there is no saved filehandle, then return the error NFS4ERR_RESTOREFH <NULL>.

16.29.5.  IMPLEMENTATION

Operations like OPEN and LOOKUP use the current filehandle to represent a directory and replace it with a new filehandle <NULL>.  Assuming that the previous filehandle was saved with a SAVEFH operator, the previous filehandle can be restored as the current filehandle <NULL>.  This is commonly used to obtain post-operation attributes for the directory, e.g.,

PUTFH (directory filehandle)
SAVEFH
GETATTR attrbits     (pre-op dir attrs)
CREATE optbits "foo" attrs
GETATTR attrbits     (file attributes)
RESTOREFH
GETATTR attrbits     (post-op dir attrs)
