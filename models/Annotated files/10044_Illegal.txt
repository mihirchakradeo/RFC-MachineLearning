16.38.  Operation 10044: ILLEGAL - Illegal Operation

16.38.1.  SYNOPSIS

     <null> -> ()

16.38.2.  ARGUMENT

     void;

16.38.3.  RESULT

   struct ILLEGAL4res {
           nfsstat4        status;
   };

16.38.4.  DESCRIPTION

This operation is a placeholder for encoding a result to handle the case of the client sending an operation code within COMPOUND that is not supported <NULL>.  See Section 15.2.4 for more details <NULL>.

The status field of ILLEGAL4res MUST be set to NFS4ERR_OP_ILLEGAL <NULL>.

16.38.5.  IMPLEMENTATION

A client will probably not send an operation with code OP_ILLEGAL, but if it does, the response will be ILLEGAL4res, just as it would be with any other invalid operation code <NULL>.  Note that if the server gets an illegal operation code that is not OP_ILLEGAL, and if the server checks for legal operation codes during the XDR decode phase, then the ILLEGAL4res would not be returned <NULL>.
