16.15.  Operation 17: NVERIFY - Verify Difference in Attributes

16.15.1.  SYNOPSIS

     (cfh), fattr -> -

16.15.2.  ARGUMENT

   struct NVERIFY4args {
           /* CURRENT_FH: object */
           fattr4          obj_attributes;
   };

16.15.3.  RESULT

   struct NVERIFY4res {
           nfsstat4        status;
   };

16.15.4.  DESCRIPTION

This operation is used to prefix a sequence of operations to be performed if one or more attributes have changed on some file system object <NULL>.  If all the attributes match, then the error NFS4ERR_SAME must be returned <NULL>.

On success, the current filehandle retains its value <NULL>.


16.15.5.  IMPLEMENTATION

This operation is useful as a cache validation operator <NULL>.  If the object to which the attributes belong has changed, then the following operations may obtain new data associated with that object -- for instance, to check if a file has been changed and obtain new data if it has:

PUTFH  (public)
LOOKUP "foobar"
NVERIFY attrbits attrs
READ 0 32767

In the case that a RECOMMENDED attribute is specified in the NVERIFY operation and the server does not support that attribute for the file system object, the error NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP is returned to the client <NULL>.

When the attribute rdattr_error or any write-only attribute (e.g., time_modify_set) is specified, the error NFS4ERR_INVAL is returned to  the client <NULL>.
