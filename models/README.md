# Jupyter notebook for creating training data

The create_train_data.ipynb contains scripts to generate training data from all the RFC txts.

The data is stored in a csv file called train_data.csv.

The format of the csv is as follows:

		- entity: entity is the actual text highlighted during annotation on brat
		- tag: the corresponding tag of Variable/Value
	
	
For creating csv file without the empty spaces, run the cell in the notebook which says so.
